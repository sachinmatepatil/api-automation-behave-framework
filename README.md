🧪 Behave API Automation Framework

This is a BDD-style API automation framework built using Python, Behave, and Allure Reporting, integrated with GitHub Actions CI/CD. It is designed for REST API testing with a focus on clean structure, reusability, and real-world practices.

📌 Features

✅ BDD with Behave and Gherkin syntax

✅ Data-driven testing support

✅ Advanced validations (headers, schema, response structure)

✅ Retry mechanism & timeout handling

✅ Allure reporting for HTML reports

✅ Logging with timestamps

✅ .env support for secure configuration

✅ GitHub Actions for CI/CD

✅ Modular structure (utilities, steps, configs)

```

🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/behave-api-testing-framework.git
cd behave-api-testing-framework
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add .env file

Create a `.env` file in root:

```
BASE_URL=https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/
EMAIL=admin
PASSWORD=password123
```

4. Run tests with Allure output

```bash
behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports/allure-results
```

5. Generate Allure HTML report

```bash
allure generate reports/allure-results -o reports/allure-report --clean
allure open reports/allure-report
```

🤖 GitHub Actions – CI/CD

On every push to main, GitHub Actions:

- Sets up Python
- Installs dependencies
- Runs Behave tests
- Uploads Allure result artifacts

Sample workflow:

`.github/workflows/behave-tests.yml`

```yaml
name: Run Behave Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o reports/allure-results
```

📊 Logging

Logging is handled via `logger.py`:

```log
2025-08-31 14:30:22 - INFO - Base URL is set to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
```
